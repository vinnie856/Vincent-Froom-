# Vincent-Froom-
Founder &amp; Systems Builder   AI Safety • Cybersecurity • Governance Frameworks   Canada 🇨🇦I design and ship **practical security and governance systems** for organizations deploying autonomous and high-risk AI My work focuses on **behavioral risk evaluation**, runtime monitoring, and enterprise-grade controls for agentic systems
## 🔍 Current Focus

- **AI Safety & Alignment** — behavioral evaluation over static compliance
- **Cybersecurity & Risk Governance** — detection, containment, escalation
- **Autonomous & Agentic Systems** — runtime oversight and control layers
- **Applied Frameworks** — tools that security teams can actually deploy

---

## 🧠 Flagship Work

### **SCAB Protocol**
A behavioral framework for evaluating AI systems across six risk domains:
**Sovereignty, Coherence, Alignment, Boundaries, Agency, and Probity**

- Designed for autonomous and semi-autonomous systems
- Outputs governance-ready risk signals
- Built for integration into security, compliance, and insurance workflows

### **AgentCops**
An AI monitoring and governance platform that applies SCAB at runtime to:
- Detect misalignment and unsafe behavior
- Track agentic drift over time
- Provide actionable escalation paths for operators

### **TrustShield**
Applied SCAB scoring tools for:
- Organizations
- Auditors
- Risk & compliance teams

## 🛠 Technology Stack

- **Languages:** Swift, Python, JavaScript  
- **Frameworks:** SwiftUI, Node.js, Flask  
- **Platforms:** iOS, Web, Cloud  
- **Domains:** AI Safety, Cybersecurity, Governance, Risk Scoring

## 🧭 Why This Work Matters

As AI systems gain autonomy, traditional security controls fail.  
Static policies, audits, and checklists cannot capture **runtime behavior**.

My work focuses on:
- Preventing rogue or unsafe AI behavior
- Making AI governance operational, not theoretical
- Giving security teams tools that match modern AI risk
